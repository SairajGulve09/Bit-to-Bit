# Byte-to-Byte

This project is a simple demonstration of WebSocket communication between a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (for React frontend)
- Java JDK (for Spring Boot backend)
- Maven (optional, but recommended for managing dependencies in the backend)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get this project up and running on your local machine:

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Build the project using Maven:
5. Run the Spring Boot application:
6. The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies using npm:
3. Start the React development server:
4. The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can interact with the WebSocket by opening the frontend in your browser.

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You should see a simple UI with WebSocket connection status.
- Interact with the UI to send and receive WebSocket messages.
